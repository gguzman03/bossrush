# About BossRush
This is the code for BossRush, a Flutter Game that uses the Flame engine, Flutter's provided flutter-games-basic as a template, and the flame_tiled package for primary game functionality. In addition, the game uses WeatherAPI to generate the background color, as well as flame_audio as a surefire method to create sounds.


## Reflection

a misinterpretation of the Proof of Concept cost me some time, as I had to have a protoype of the game as opposed to just
game navigation, but I 
given more time, i think i could have gotten some details out of the way
In fact, I do plan to look over this assignment even after the semester to add more and polish existing functionality.

## Sources and References

A tutorial for a game made with flame_tiled by Spellthorn was my primary influence for this project, as it not only provided the bare basics for a 
platformer with functioning physics, but also provided inspiration for the more unique aspects of my game. In addition, it provided pointers for a game platorm on mobile, as well as clarified many preexisting topics covered in class.

The art for the Player, Boss, Item, and Map are custom made. The pixel art for the former three can be found on my PixilArt.

Sound files for the player jump and item collection were custom made, and they were generated on sfxr.me

Any other visuals (fonts, music, icons, non-player sounds) are provided by the flutter-game-basics package.
